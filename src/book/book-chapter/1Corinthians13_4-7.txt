1 Corinthians 13:4-7

Verse: "Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast,
it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not
easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but
rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres."

Explanation: This passage tells us that it defines the nature of true love,
which is central to Christian relationships. It serves as a guide
